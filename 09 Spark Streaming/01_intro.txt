Spark Streaming
-extension of Spark API to process live data streams
-data can be ingested from many sources (Kafka, Flume, Kinesis) 
-and data can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high level functions like map, reduce, join and window

(Kafka/Flume/HDFS/S3/Kinesis/Twitter) -> Spark Streaming -> (HDFS/Databases/Dashboards)

Live I/P data streams -> Spark Streaming -> divdes into batches -> processed by Spark Engine-> generate final stream of results in batches
