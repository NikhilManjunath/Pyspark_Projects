-> Unsupervised algorithm
-> Tries to convert unlabeled data into clusters

Steps:
-> Choose number of clusters (from domain knowledge/guess)
-> Randomly assign each point to a cluster
-> Until no change in clusters, repeat:
    -> compute cluster centroid for each cluster by taking mean of all points in the cluster
    -> reassign each point again to a new cluster based on the nearest centroid

Choosing K value:
-> compute sum of squared error (SSE) for some values of k (2,4,6,8,..)
-> plot k vs SSE (error decreases with larger k)
-> choose k at which SSE decreases abruptly
