2 types:
    - Content Based 
        -> focuses on attributes of items and suggests based on similarity between items
    - Collaborative Filtering (CF) 
        -> recommend based on users attitude on items
        -> more common, gives better results, easier to understand

->does feature learning on its own (identifies which features to use)

->aim to match user-item in an association matrix
->spark.ml supports model based Collaborative Filtering
    -> users and products described by small set of latent factors used to predict
    -> uses ALS (Alternative Least Squares) to learn the latent factors
    -> data needs to be in a specific format to work
