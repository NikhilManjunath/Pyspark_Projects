MLlib
-> Spark Library for ML
-> for Unsupervised and Supervised ML learning tasks
-> Need to format data such that it eventually has:
    - 2 columns (Features, Labels) for Supervised
    - 1 column (Features) for Unsupervised
-> requires more data processing work than other ML Libraries
-> but exact same syntax will work with distributed data

Good idea to go through the MLlib documentation available on PySpark website
