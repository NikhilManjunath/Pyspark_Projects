Examples:
-Clustering news articles
-sugesting similar books
-grouping legal docs
-spam email detection

Basic Process:
1. Compile all docs into a Corpus
2. Featurize the words to numerics
3. Compare features of documents

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
Ex: 
    Doc1 contains 'Blue House'
    Doc2 contains 'Red House'

    Featurize based on word count:
    'Blue House' -> (red,blue,house) -> (0,1,1)
    'Red House' -> (red,blue,house) -> (1,0,1)

    Hence, each doc represented as a vector of word counts
    Hence, we have vectors in n-dim space
    We compare vectors with cosine similarity
    Hence, we get similarity between the docs

    Term Frequency - importance of a term within the doc
    TF(x,y) - count of occurences of term x in doc y

    Inverse Document Frequency - importance of term in the Corpus
    IDF(t) = log(N/dfx) 
        ->N = total # of docs
        ->dfx = # of docs with the term

    Finally,
    W(x,y) = TF(x,y)*IDF(x)
